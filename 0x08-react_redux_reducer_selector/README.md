## :bulb: Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google:**

* The purpose of a reducer and the role it plays within your application
* Why a reducer should stay as pure as possible
* Why mutations should not happen within a reducer
* The use of Immutable within the reducer
* The use of Normalizr within the app
* Selectors: what they are and when to use them
